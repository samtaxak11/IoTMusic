# IoT Music

## Deployed Link : https://iotmusic.netlify.app/

## Overview

The "IoT Music" web application enables users to upload audio files (e.g., mp3) and construct playlists. Utilizing built-in Browser APIs, the app stores audio files locally. Users can access and interact with playlists, along with a "now playing" view that indicates the currently active audio file. Playback utilizes the standard HTML audio player, allowing seamless transitions to subsequent files in the playlist upon completion. 

Additionally, the application ensures a consistent user experience by saving the last played audio file and its playback position. This feature allows users to resume playback from the previous position upon page reload.
